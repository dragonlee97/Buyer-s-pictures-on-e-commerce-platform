# Buyer-s-pictures-on-e-commerce-platform
Graduation paper

    On e-commerce platforms, product comments, especially customer images, from buyers are increasingly gaining attention in recent years, 
which can influence other buyers’ purchase decision. The previous literature only considered the seller’s image or electronic word of mouth
alone, without taking the buyer's image and its interaction with the two factors into account. Based on the analysis of women's clothing on
China's largest e-commerce platform, Taobao, this paper examined the effects of the buyer's picture and the seller's picture in the color 
saliency and the degree of detail on sales, in order to determine whether the buyer's show and the seller's show have the same impact on 
the consumer's decision. In the same way, given the equal importance of textual eWOM, the moderating effect of comment length factor and 
comment sentiment factors is also considered.

    This research uses Hue-Saturation variance, edge detection, and sentiment analysis tools to extract relevant data from sellers' show, 
buyers' pictures and comment texts. Using negative binomial regression model and cross-term moderating factors, we obtained the results 
indicating that the color saliency of the seller's show attract the attention of consumers, but the color saliency of the buyer's show 
will weaken this favorable effect; whether it is a seller show or a buyer show, showing too much clothing details will negatively affect 
the product sales; the average length of the comments does not moderate the effect of the buyer's show image on the sales volume, while 
the comments' emotions have a regulatory effect.
